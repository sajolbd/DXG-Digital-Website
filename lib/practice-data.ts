Facing Deportation Does Not Mean You Are Out of Options

A deportation notice can feel overwhelming, but it is not the end of the road. Immigration law is complex, and many people qualify for defenses they are not aware of.

At Tripathi Vongsyprasom Law, we defend individuals and families facing removal proceedings. From cancellation of removal to asylum claims, waivers, and motions to reopen, our team evaluates every possible legal path to protect your right to remain in the United States.

Timing matters. The earlier you act, the more options you may have.

DUI charges can have serious consequences, including license suspension, fines, increased insurance rates, and possible jail time. For non-citizens, DUI convictions may also affect immigration status. Immediate legal action is crucial.

Our DUI defense strategy is tailored to the facts of each case. We analyze traffic stops, arrest procedures, breath or blood tests, and police reports for legal errors. Unlawful stops, improper testing, or constitutional violations are aggressively challenged.

We negotiate with prosecutors to seek reduced charges or dismissals whenever possible. Our objective is protecting your license, freedom, and long-term future through strong and strategic defense.
